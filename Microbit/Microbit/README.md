#  Micro:bit Test App.
This project is designed to test the Micro:bit Bluetooth interface contained in file Microbit.swift.

It includes a User Inteface coded programatically rather than using Xcode's Interface Builder so that the
Test App can be used as a Swift Playground. Therefore, AppDelegate  sets and instance of MicrobitUIController as  the
root view controller.
